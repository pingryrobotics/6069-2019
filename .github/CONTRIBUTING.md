# Contributing to 6069's team code for the 2019-2020 season

## Working on an existing feature in development
1. Clone the repository to your local computer
2. Checkout the feature/issue branch
3. Make changes, write a detailed commit message, then push them to the shared branch for that feature
4. If development for that feature is done, and has been tested, rebase from the latest commit to the development branch, then create a pull request from your branch into the development branch.
5. Ask a team member (probably @mielwyn) to review the pull request, and merge it into development
